Description of physical setup:		
The data comes from a continuous flow process.		
Sample rate is 1 Hz.		
In the first stage, Machines 1, 2,  and 3 operate in parallel, and feed their outputs into a step that combines the flows.		
Output from the combiner is measured in 15 locations. These measurements are the primary measurements to predict.		
Next, the output flows into a second stage, where Machines 4 and 5 process in series.		
Measurements are made again in the same 15 locations. These are the secondary measurements to predict.		
		
Measurements are noisy.		
Each measurement also has a target or Setpoint (setpoints are included in the first row of data).		
The goal is to predict the measurements (or the error versus setpoints) for as many of the 15 measurements as possible.		
Some measurements will be more predictable than others!		
Prediction of measurements after the first stage are the primary interest.		
Prediction of measurements after the second stage are nice-to-have but the data is much more noisy.		
		
Note on variable naming conventions		
~.C.Setpoint		Setpoint for Controlled variable
~.C.Actual		Actual value of Controlled variable
~.U.Actual		Actual value of Uncontrolled variable
Others		Environmental or raw material variables, States / events, etc.
